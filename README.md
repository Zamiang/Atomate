# ATOMATE - Your digital personal assistant


Atomate is a your personal, extra smart note taking tool. It does two
key things: It reminds you about things when you tell it to, and it
gives you one place to keep the info you need for you day. Atomate
does this by bringing different types of things like reminders,
contacts, todos and events (that are normall scattared across
many apps) together in one place. Atomate first imports and syncs
your data from the apps you already use and then gives you one
place to search, filter and add new stuff -- accessible on your phone
and your web browser


## Demo

Working on it!


## Goal

Our goal is to help you stop worrying about where stuff is or what
you're supposed to do, and get on with your day.


## More info

This application is free and open source. It has been supported by
many years (?decades?) of acedemic research. Progress is actively
documented in the ACM SIGCHI and WWW communities.

## Usage Scenerios

- an example!
- more examples
- You enter: "remind me to take out the trash on Sunday" Atoamte will
  remind you to do that at a reasonable time on Sunday-- can dismiss
  w/ a 'remind me later' button


## Things to keep in mind (from @chrysaora)

- It is totally unreasonable to expect people to ditch services
they're already using for another one. There are too many factors
(what work requires, habit, fear of losing back-data) to even consider
this. It's feasible that they might look to an aggregator, however,
but changes should be able to propagate backwards.

- Separation is natural: I use 3 or 4 different programs to keep To-do
lists AND paper, if it gets real serious. In just one of those
programs, I have like 6 different to-do lists. This is not because I
hate efficiency, but because creating a little bit of organizational
space for a project helps me get into the right mental space for it. I
think you can accomplish this with a good system of filters, but the
system will have to be easier to use than "hit cmd-n in a text editor"

- The reason why people worry about instead of doing dumb little
things is because many of them are trivial when you're in the right
mood and TERRIBLE when you're not. Believe me, as someone who is
self-managed and also works from home; it's all about "I guess I feel
like doing the dishes now" because really, I could do them ANY TIME.
For example, it's well and good that your system could remind me to
take out the trash on Sunday evening, but what if I'm in the middle of
watching a movie? Or eating dinner? I'm not sure how to work around
this best, but maybe a snooze button feature?


## TODO:

- figure out some scenerios
- update atomate.me
- update mypoyozo.com
- create mailing list
- donation button
- design a compelling demo
- data syncing from home computer to android
- basic android (web) app
- location based reminders like what Atomate had (and now iOS5 has)

## LATER:
- history view (poyozo)
- more data sources
- "PLEASE MAKE AN "AUTO-SCHEDULE MY WEEK FOR ME" - Moot
